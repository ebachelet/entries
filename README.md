This repo is intended to receive submitted entries for the 1st microlensing data challenge.  

A detailed description of the contents of the entries can be found here:
http://microlensing-source.org/data-challenge-entry-contents/

Entries should be submitted in the form of a tarball and named according to the following naming convention:
<team_name>_<date_time_stamp>.tar

When you have uploaded your tarball, please email the organizer, Rachel Street rstreet@lco.global, who will download it and remove it from the repo.

Please note that Github has a filesize limit of 25MB.  Feel free to use any publicly available compression tool to fit within this limit (fpack, gzip, bzip2 for example).  If your complete entry is still too large, please email Rachel Street and provide a link from which the entry tarball can be downloaded.
